# Line drawings

These have been manually drawn using [EazyDraw for Mac](http://eazydraw.com) and exported as EPS files.  They are organized by chapter and named figC_N.eps where C is the chapter number and N is the figure number.

Unfortunately EPS files can't be viewed on GitHub, but the figures will look just like those included in the book.
