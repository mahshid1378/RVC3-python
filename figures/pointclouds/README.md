# Viewable 3D point clouds

Some figures in the book are created using [Open3D](https://www.open3d.org)
but their 2D representation on the page is a bit dull and potentially ambiguous.

Those figures are included here in
[PCD](https://pointclouds.org/documentation/tutorials/pcd_file_format.html) and
[PLY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PLY_(file_format)) formats.  You can
visualize these files locally use [meshlab]() or the VSCode extension [3D Viewer
Light](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tatsy.vscode-3d-preview).

Hotlinks in the book take you to a web-based online point cloud viewer, based on
[3js](threejs.org), that uses a [glTF](https://docs.fileformat.com/3d/gltf/)
version of the file.
