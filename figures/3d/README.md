# Viewable 3D figures

Some "3D" figures in the book are created using [PyVista](https://www.pyvista.org)
but their 2D representation is a bit dull and potentially ambiguous.

Those figures are included here as [glTF](https://docs.fileformat.com/3d/gltf/) format files which are viewable using 3D visualization tools such as the VSCode extension [glTF Tools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=cesium.gltf-vscode).


Hotlinks in the book take you to a web-based online point cloud viewer, based on
[3js](threejs.org), that renders these files.
